 📊 Project Description

This notebook explores the **Seaborn `tips` dataset**, which contains information about restaurant bills, tips, and customer demographics. Using Pandas, we generate descriptive statistics to understand the dataset better.

### Dataset Overview
- The dataset includes **244 entries** with details such as:
  - **Categorical columns**: `sex`, `smoker`, `day`, `time`
  - **Numerical columns**: `total_bill`, `tip`, `size`

### Key Findings
- **Meal Time**: Customers are recorded as either **Lunch** or **Dinner**, with dinner being more frequent.
- **Categorical Summary**:
  - Majority of customers are **Male**.
  - Most are **non-smokers**.
  - **Saturday dinners** are the most common.
- **Numerical Summary**:
  - Average **total bill** ≈ 19.8  
  - Average **tip** ≈ 3.0  
  - Bills show high variability, while tips remain within a predictable range.
  - Average **group size** ≈ 2–3, indicating mostly couples or small groups.
- **Data Quality**: No missing values in numeric columns, making the dataset clean and ready for analysis.

### Insights
- Customers generally spend a **moderate amount** on meals.  
- **Tipping behavior** is fairly consistent across the dataset.  
- **Small groups dominate** the dining pattern.  
- The dataset is well-structured and suitable for further statistical analysis or visualization.
